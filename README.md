# My Personal Website
I have decided to redesign my website resume, apply the knowledge from user interface design, UX and development for this project.

The result is a clean personal space on the internet with a clear message of my skills, the technologies I use and the things that I have done along with my career.

I will integrate a blog space in the future and learning React and Gatsby at the same time.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, Iâ€™ll keep you posted!
